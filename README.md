# Private asset pricing via machine learning

I have recently worked at professor Xiu's research on private asset pricing via machine learning. There is a link for the paper https://dachxiu.chicagobooth.edu/download/ML.pdf. 

The objective of this project is to mimic his approach to a new dataset, repeating each machine learning measure and comparing their performance.
